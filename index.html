                I’m interested in IT and everything and everything in its orbit. 
                I recently got carried away by web programming. 
                I’m keen to gain more experience in this field. 
                That’s why I signed up for <b>RSschool</b> courses. 
                I’m looking forward to receive essential knowledge about Java Script and web development 
                and I hope that will help me to build my career.
